questions: can you give me:
- a list of "causes"
- a list of "types" of organization (e.g. envrionmental, human rights, etc)
- do organizations have both a cause and a type?
- how to recognize somebody's network from facebook? Perhaps just let them choose a network on the site? (this would also allow non-FB people to sign up and also make things easier for me.)
- what are badges given for?

Comments:
Homepage, Org page - Erez will send designs 
2. Feed - show donations, 'announcements' (like earning a badge, or maybe 'expressing interest in a charity')
3. Supply your total yearly income
4. donations - don't show amount 
5. User profile page - featured organizations and causes (not just one) with text. 
6. Charity Badges: a charity gets a badge if it gets rated by givewell's top-rated charities. 
7. User badges: 1. whether total donations reaches some percentage of income, 2. whether a % of donations are to 'highly effective charities' (those with givewell rating).
