          <h1 class="about-intro">We made Giving Profiles to help you help others</h1>
          <p class="about-paragraph">Giving Profiles is a simple way to collect all your charitable donations in a single place. Use it to keep track of your giving, share your favorite charities with friends, and discover great new organizations to support. We are a team of researchers from Harvard and Yale who specialize in motivating people to do more good. We're not venture capitalists, or serial-startup-ists, and we're not here to make a buck. We're here to put our research into practice, and see if we can help you make the biggest difference you can.</p>
